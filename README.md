# 👋 Hi there! Bonjour!
Hello there! I'm CJ, an open-source enthusiast. Love #r, #python, #crypto, and love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-world problems. 

It's been a long while since I first desired to become data analytics and this year I took the chance to embrace the art of data.
